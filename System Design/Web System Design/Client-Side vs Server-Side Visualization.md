##  Performance Comparison

Client-side chart rendering is significantly faster than server-side rendering for most use cases.
**Transfer Time** Server-side rendering sends larger HTML chart files compared to lightweight JSON data sent for client-side rendering, resulting in longer transfer times.
**Processing Time** Server-side chart generation takes considerably longer than client-side rendering.
**Scalability** Server-side rendering performance exponentially decreases when user base increases.

## When each approach excels
***Client-Side Rendering***
1. Interactive dashboard
2. Small to medium dataset based visualization
3. High traffic applications
4. Multiple concurrent users
***Server-side Rending***
5. Massive dataset
6. Static report generation
7. SEO-Critical Content
8. Low powered client devices
9. Security sensitive scenarios

The overwhelming industry standard for modern data visualization dashboards is client-side rendering with back end data aggregation. Here's what leading companies implement:[](https://github.com/ericlewis966/DashBoard/blob/master/docs/developer/architecture.md)​

**Netflix**:[](https://netflixtechblog.com/lumen-custom-self-service-dashboarding-for-netflix-8c56b541548c)​

- Front end fetches pre-aggregated data via APIs
    
- Visualization rendered client-side using JavaScript libraries
    
- Self-service dashboards (Lumen) use client-side rendering
    
- Backend performs data joins and aggregations, not chart rendering
    

**Airbnb**:[](https://www.systemdesignhandbook.com/guides/airbnb-system-design-interview/)​

- Microservices architecture with API gateway
    
- Frontend clients perform all visualization rendering
    
- Backend services handle search, ranking, and data processing
    
- CDN delivers static visualization library assets
    

**Google Analytics**:[](https://www.grorapidlabs.com/blog/using-looker-studio-for-google-analytics-data-visualisation-a-beginners-guide-to-ga4)​

- Client-side data collection and visualization
    
- JavaScript tracking code runs in browser
    
- Looker Studio (Google Data Studio) renders all charts client-side
    
- Backend provides aggregated query results as JSON
    

**Power BI / Tableau**:[](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/tableau-speed-and-performance/client-vs-server-side-rendering)​

- Primarily client-side rendering for interactive dashboards
    
- Server-side rendering only used when dashboard complexity exceeds ~120 (complexity score) or for mobile devices with limited resources[](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/tableau-speed-and-performance/client-vs-server-side-rendering)​
    
- Client-side used when complexity < 80 for full interactivity
