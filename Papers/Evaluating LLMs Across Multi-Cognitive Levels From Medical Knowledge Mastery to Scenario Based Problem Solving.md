**Bloom's Taxonomy:** This is a framework used in education to classify learning objectives into different levels of complexity. The revised version includes: Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analysing, Evaluating, and Creating. In this paper, the authors adapt it to three levels for medical evaluation.
**Multi-Cognitive-Level Evaluation Framework (MultiCogEval):** This is a new method proposed to assess LLMs not just on basic knowledge but on higher-order skills like application and problem-solving.
**Key Finding:** LLMs perform well on basic knowledge tasks but decline as cognitive complexity increases. Model size matters more for complex tasks.
